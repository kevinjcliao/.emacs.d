Kill buffers selected by BUFFER-DESIGNATOR with KILLING-FUNCTION.

See description of `kill-or-bury-alive--buffer-match' for
information about the concept of buffer designators.

Normally, KILLING-FUNCTION should be able to take one argument:
buffer object.  However, you can use a function that operates on
current buffer and doesn't take any arguments.  Just pass non-NIL
SIMPLE argument and KILLING-FUNCTION will be wrapped as needed
automatically.

Kill or bury current buffer.

This is universal killing mechanism.  When argument ARG is given
and it's not NIL, kill current buffer.  Otherwise behavior of
this command varies.  If current buffer matches a buffer
designator listed in `kill-or-bury-alive-must-die-list', kill it
immediately, otherwise just bury it.

You can specify how to kill various kinds of buffers, see
`kill-or-bury-alive-killing-function-alist' for more information.
Buffers are killed with `kill-or-bury-alive-killing-function' by
default.

Kill all buffers except for long lasting ones.

Long lasting buffers are specified in `kill-or-bury-alive-long-lasting-list'.

If `kill-or-bury-alive-base-buffer' is not NIL, switch to buffer
with that name after purging and delete all other windows.

When ARG is given and it's not NIL, ask to confirm killing of
every buffer.
