;;; Commentary:

;; This is a library for computing context menus based on text
;; properties and overlays. The intended use is to have tools that
;; annotate source code and others that use these annotations, without
;; requiring a direct coupling between them, but maintaining
;; discoverability.

;; Major modes that wish to use this library should first define an
;; appropriate value for `prop-menu-item-functions'. Then, they should
;; bind `prop-menu-by-completing-read' to an appropriate
;; key. Optionally, a mouse pop-up can be added by binding
;; `prop-menu-show-menu' to a mouse event.

        (setq k (pop this-plist))

Each function should take a plist as its argument and return a
list of menu items. A menu item consists of a string to be
displayed to the user and a command to be executed if that item
is selected. Separators can be added by using \"--\" as the string.

Major modes that provide context menus are expected to populate
this variable with appropriate functions.")
